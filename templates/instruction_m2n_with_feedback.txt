You previously predicted the following {x} patches (Patch {previous_start_index} to Patch {previous_end_index}):

{predicted_patches}

However, the actual values for these {x} patches (Patch {previous_start_index} to Patch {previous_end_index}) are:

{actual_patches}

Based on what you have learned so far, let's try again.

Please predict Patch {next_start_index} to Patch {next_end_index}, taking into account the feedback above. Use the same format as before:

**Response Format Rules**:
1. Output ONLY the predicted patch data without any explanations, comments, or additional text.
2. Each patch must follow this exact format:
   - Patch header: "===== Patch {{index}} =====" (indices start from the index after the last input patch index)
   - Data rows: Each row in format "date,open,high,low,close"
   - Patch separator: Blank line between patches

3. Example response format (output exactly like this):
===== Patch {{start_index}} =====
{{date1}},{{open1}},{{high1}},{{low1}},{{close1}}
{{date2}},{{open2}},{{high2}},{{low2}},{{close2}}
...

===== Patch {{next_index}} =====
...

**WARNING**: Do not include any explanations, comments, or additional text in your response. Output ONLY the patch data in the format above.
