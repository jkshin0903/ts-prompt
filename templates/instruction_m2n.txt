The following is time series data. Based on the {m} rows provided below, please predict the time series information for the next {n} rows and write them in the same format.

The data is structured consecutively in chronological order (by date/timestamp), and the predicted rows should start from the time point immediately after the last date/timestamp in the input rows.

Input rows:
{input_rows}

**IMPORTANT**: Based on the input rows above, please predict the next {n} rows.

**Response Format Rules**:
1. Output ONLY the predicted row data without any explanations, comments, or additional text.
2. Each row must follow this exact format:
   - Data row: "{{date/timestamp}},{{feature1}},{{feature2}},{{feature3}},..."
     * The first column is date/timestamp (required)
     * The remaining columns are numeric feature values (same number and order as input rows)
   - One row per line

3. Example response format (output exactly like this):
{{date1}},{{feature1_1}},{{feature2_1}},{{feature3_1}},...
{{date2}},{{feature1_2}},{{feature2_2}},{{feature3_2}},...
{{date3}},{{feature1_3}},{{feature2_3}},{{feature3_3}},...
...

**WARNING**: Do not include any explanations, comments, or additional text in your response. Output ONLY the row data in the format above. The number of feature columns in your prediction must match the number of feature columns in the input rows.
